* Explain your understanding of the box model and how you would tell the browser in CSS to render your layout in different box models.
      he box model consist of its content with a width and a height, then the padding, then the border, then the margin. naturally, if we dont specify the height or width of the content, then it is only as high and wide as the content is where the height will have some padding and the width wont have any padding.
